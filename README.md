## Project Description

A. Problem Statement
 
Thousands of houses are sold everyday. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house deserves? Am I paying a fair price?

B. Best Possible Solutions

a.Housing Expert

b.Intuition About House

c.Using Machine Learning

C. Introduction About Project

House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.

2. Data Collection


For this project we used the data that is available on kaggle.(click here for data).There are 26 columns and 318851 Rows. These are the major point about the data set.
url: the url which fetches the data
id: the id of transaction
Lng: and Lat coordinates, using the BD09 protocol.
Cid: community id
tradeTime: the time of transaction
DOM: active days on market
followers: the number of people follow the transaction.
totalPrice: the total price
price: the average price by square
square: the square of house
livingRoom: the number of living room
drawingRoom: the number of drawing room
kitchen: the number of kitchen
bathroom the number of bathroom
floor: the height of the house. I will turn the Chinese characters to English in the next version.
buildingType: including tower( 1 ) , bungalow( 2 )ï¼Œcombination of plate and tower( 3 ), plate( 4 ).
constructionTime: the time of construction
renovationCondition: including other( 1 ), rough( 2 ),Simplicity( 3 ), hardcover( 4 )
buildingStructure: including unknow( 1 ), mixed( 2 ), brick and wood( 3 ), brick and concrete( 4 ),steel( 5 ) and steel-concrete composite ( 6 ).
ladderRatio: the proportion between number of residents on the same floor and number of elevator of ladder. It describes how many ladders a resident have on average.
elevator: have ( 1 ) or not have elevator( 0 )
fiveYearsProperty: if the owner have the property for less than 5 years.
## Data Cleaning
we have 26 columns ,from these we don't want some column(i.e. url,id,cid) then we will perform data cleaning wich involve following steps. our target variable is totalPrice
a. Impute/Remove missing values or Null values (NaN)

b. Remove unnecessary and corrupted data.

c. Date/Text parsing if required.

some column have unique character. we solve these problem using split method and create seprate column for unique character.

We also have a categorical data we handle such kind of data using dummies variable concept. following are the columns which have categorical data.

a. RenovationCondition

b. buildingStructure

c. buildingType

d. district

e. elevator

f. floor_type

So,these are the top 20 features for our model
a. tradeTime
b. CommunityAverage
c. square
d. livingRoom
e. bathRoom
f. drawingRoom
g. renovationCondition
h. buildingStructure
i. elevator
j. constructionTime
k. Followers

C. Data Normalization
Normalization (min-max Normalization)
In this approach we scale down the feature in between 0 to 1

we have numerical column where we can apply min-max Normalization.


5. Choosing Best ML Model
List of the model that we can use for our problem

a. LinearRegression model

b. KNN Model

c. Decesion Tree

d. Random Forest

6. Model Creation
So,using a RandomForest we got good accuracy , we can Hyperparameter tuning for best accuracy.

Algorithm that can be used for Hyperparameter tuning are :-

a. GridSearchCV

b. RandomizedSearchCV

c. Bayesian Optimization-Automate Hyperparameter Tuning (Hyperopt)

d. Sequential model based optimization

e. Optuna-Automate Hyperparameter Tuning

f. Genetic Algorithm
## Model Conclusion
Model predict 90% accurately on test data and 94% accurately on train data .
## Project Innovation Project Innovation
a. Easy to use

b. open source

c. Best accuracy

d. GUI Based Application
## Limitation and Next Step
Limitation are :-

a. Mobile Application

b. Accuracy can be improve

c. Model Size is heavy(~310 mb )

d. Feature is limited

Next Step are :-

a. we will work on mobile application

b. we will reduce the size of model using PCA .
